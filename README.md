# Horiseon Website: Code Refactor
Horiseon Code Refactor 

## Description 

Horiseon is a marketing company that sought to improve their codebase in order to optimize their exposue via various search engines. In order to best serve this marketing firm's goals, it was necessary to review and refactor it's website. First, I began by testing the functionality of the application. I wanted all aspects of the website to function as intended. It was then that I noticed that the link for "Search Engine Optimization" wasn't functioning. A quick adjustment to the header class rectified this malfunction.

Next, I began to condense and scrub the existing html format. For example, some of the text extended beyond the standard window requiring the developer to scroll to the right. I eliminated the need to scroll by placing it on the line below. I also eliminated unnecessary spacing and line usage. Several p and h tags, which once took up three lines, now only require one line. After changing the format of the html doc, I changed the div's to html semantic elements as well as added alt tags to the website images. These additions should increase the website visability and functionality of future use. 

After revising the html doc, I moved on to the CSS style sheet. Again, I combined multiple classes with like characteristics. Such as font size, color, and dimension. Each class is listed and combined via comma. All photo images are included in an external folder.
